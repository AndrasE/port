## Hi there 👋

This project was part of my self-study. I wanted to learn more about CSS, JS & event-listeners. I found an awesome tutorial on youtube☝, which I followed. Once it the design was completed I took on the project on and rewrite many aspect of it, especially JS. Added new animations, Lazy-embeddings and just restructuried the original code. 

Take care, code safe! 💻

## Run 🚀
