Dynamic Portfolio Webpage
<br>
Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
</h3> 

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This webpage showcases my proficiency in crafting dynamic web experiences using only vanilla JavaScript and CSS. While inspired by a YouTube **[tutorial](https://youtu.be/zJE-ze4TfXc)** via **[CrypticalCode](https://www.youtube.com/@CrypticalCoder)**. I've extensively customized and enhanced the original design to align with my personal vision.

I began by meticulously analyzing the tutorial's code, gaining a deep understanding of its structural and design principles. From there, I tailored the project to my specific requirements, incorporating new elements and functionalities.

For a more detailed exploration of the project's journey and capabilities, please visit the 'Read More' section at the project page.
