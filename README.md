## Hi there 👋

This project was part of my self-study. I wanted to learn more about CSS, JS & event-listeners. I found an awesome tutorial on youtube ☝, which I followed. Once it the design was completed I took on the project and rewrote many aspect of it, especially the JS. Added new animations, Lazy-embeddings, restructured the project and much more. If you would like to read about it more, go to the website ➡ check projects ➡ you will find an about this project section and a video about it. I hope it will help with your own creation. 👾

Take care, code safe! 💻

## Run 🚀
As its only uses HTML, CSS, vanilla-JS you wont need much to do so:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrasE/port
$ cd PROJECTNAME
$ open index.html
```
