Dynamic Portfolio Webpage Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
</h3> 

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This webpage showcases my proficiency in crafting dynamic web experiences using only vanilla JavaScript and CSS. While inspired by a YouTube **[tutorial](https://youtu.be/zJE-ze4TfXc)** via **[CrypticalCoder](https://www.youtube.com/@CrypticalCoder)**. I've extensively customized and enhanced the original design to align with my personal vision.

I began by meticulously analyzing the tutorial's code, gaining a deep understanding of its structural and design principles. From there, I tailored the project to my specific requirements, incorporating new elements and features such us "swipe and tap" functionalities with lazy loading.

As the project expanded, I aimed to improve navigation on this single-page site. To achieve this, I organized the website into distinct sections using EJS templates. Netlify then dynamically compiles these templates into a complete HTML file during deployment, ensuring a seamless and efficient browsing experience.

For a more detailed exploration of the project's journey and capabilities, please visit the 'Read More' section at the project page.

### Key Features

- **Lazy Loading** - Optimizes page performance by deferring the loading of non-essential elements until they are needed.  
- **Embeds** - The website includes embeds to display external content including Youtube, Codesandbox and Github pages.
- **Swipe Functionality** - Using **[hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/)** can recognize gestures made by touch, mouse and pointerEvents.
- **Custom Animations** - Smooth transitions and effects enhance the overall user experience.
- **Enhanced Functionality** - Additional features and interactions have been added to provide a more engaging experience.
