                            and confidence to pursue a career as a junior web developer.

                                            I began building projects to gain
                                            hands-on experience. I started with a React app using Firebase and
                                            multi-auth methods, including OTP. Then I built my portfolio, sharpening my
                                            CSS, JS, and DOM skills. Expanding into TypeScript and Redux, I created a
                                            React/RTK calculator. Earlier this year, I developed a React Native

                                            recently, I built a React website for a tattoo artist using
                                            styled-components, React-Scroll, Framer Motion, and Lottie. It detects
                                            browser language and theme preferences, is PWA-ready, and installable on
                                            both mobile and desktop.
