                        <p>For the past four years, alongside my full-time job, I made web development a
                            part of my daily routine through dedicated self-training and hands-on practice.
                            With this consistent effort, I`ve built the knowledge, project-based experience,
                            and confidence to pursue a career as a junior web developer.

                                            a Node REST API using Express, TypeORM, and more.

                                            After completing the Udemy Web Development course, I started
                                            building projects to gain practical experience. My first was a
                                            React app with a Firebase backend, supporting multiple
                                            authentication methods, including OTP. I then developed my
                                            portfolio, honing my CSS, JS, and DOM skills. Expanding my
                                            knowledge with TypeScript and Redux, I created a React/RTK
                                            calculator. Earlier this year, I built a React Native real-time
                                            chat app with authentication, user settings, and push
                                            notifications. Recently, I completed a React-based website for a
                                            tattoo artist, styled with styled-components and animated using
                                            React-Scroll, Framer-Motion, and Lottie-React. The site
                                            automatically detects the user's browser language and theme
                                            preferences, loading them by default. It`s a PWA-ready App and
                                            installable on both mobile and desktop.
