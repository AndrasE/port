                                        applications and browsers.
                                        It can be used both front and backend. I find JS very logical and interesting to
                                        work with.

                            <p>Let me start with a DISCLAIMER before we dive in. This webpage is not solely built by me.
                                I
                                was searching for different animated web-designs that offer me valuable assets and
                                functionalities to learn from.
                                I found a very fascinating tutorial on YouTube that sparked my interest and that I
                                considered a good fit for my goal
                                in creating a functional, smooth but also elegant webpage
                                (<a href=https://youtu.be/zJE-ze4TfXc target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>).
                                I wanted to learn more in-depth on how to use divs and classes more efficiently. By
                                writing the code parallel
                                I understood the structural and design aspects of the site, which I was so keen to
                                learn.
                                Once I finished, I started tailoring the site more to my needs and own ideas and added
                                some extra features to it. This also makes one of the highest share
                                in time I spent on a project. Although the site overall doesn`t look very different to
                                the original one,
                                there are a lot more elements and features I brought to it. You can find a detailed

                            <h3>Crud, Auth and Fire </h3>
                            <p>I wanted to create a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) React App with a backend.
                                Trying multiple options for this approach, I finally considered Firebase as the most
                                feasible
                                service for this. Once I had realized the project essentials, I wanted to experiment
                                more and
                                added
                                an authentication feature to the project, aiming that only registered users can interact
                                with
                                the database. For this I used firabse authentication and also a context-provider &
                                protected routes.
                                When visitor arrives on the landing-site an object gets created and unless the
                                authentication has
                                taken place it won`t let user go any further and gets redirected to login/register.
                                In Firebase itself, I built the set up in a way that only registered users can
                                manipulate the
                                database. You can read about this project a lot more in details by going
                                to the actual webAPP and click on the logo and read more.
                                I wanted to keep this project as simple as possible.
                                As an additional nuance, I am planning to add sessions (cookies) to the app and
                                limiting content manipulation only to the user for their own content only.

                            <p>It was a barebone project using MongoDB in the back-end with simple crud operations and
                                EJS.
                                I added an authentication feature and session cookies to the project (<a
                                    href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Express</a>). Users only can
                                interact with
                                their own content (secrets) but are able to read other user`s posts. Once a user has run
                                through
                                this authentication process, he/she will remain logged in
                                unless the cookie is expired, or the users exits the browser. You can aslo read more in

                                section of the page. Overall, I am very proud of the project outcome, in regard to how I

                                experimented with features but also in regards to user engagement, seeing that quite a

                                number of “secrets” have been shared after I posted the project link in a study group to

                            <p id="phide" class="opacity100">This started off as a coding-challange during my studies. A
                                simple react-app where
                                we practiced the correct use of <a
                                    href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">props</a> and the <a
                                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_es6_spread.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">spread operator</a>. Using React I really enjoyed that I
                                have finally something that is instant
                                and doesn`t require refresh or redirect. That is the reason why after completing the
                                challange I wanted to take this further and have a back-end for it.
                                The idea of CRUD started appear to me and eventually this project was the base for it.
                                This app never been deployed, but with the
                                help of embedding I`m still able to share it with you. Please click the button to see.

                            <h3>Basic operations using Node, Express, Ejs with MongoDB</h3>
                            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This App was a coding-challange, part of my studies on
                                Udemy. After finishing it, it also
                                served as a base to the Secrets App above. It uses <a href="https://ejs.co/"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EJS</a> (Embedded JavaScript Templating).
                                EJS let us embed JavaScript
                                code into HTML. It can come very handy for many different ways. It can reduce the
                                repetition of the
                                code. Let say you have a website with 2-3 redirect to different sections of the page.
                                You can simply write
                                the header/footer or any other parts of the webpage only once and inject it to yor HTML
                                code like follows:
                            </p>
                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;" class="example-code">
                                            &lt%=header=%&gt<br>
                                            content <br>
                                            &lt%=footer=%&gt
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                    <td>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px;" class="example-code">
                                            &lt== &nbsp unchanged <br>
                                            &lt== &nbsp changing <br>
                                            &lt== &nbsp unchanged
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                            </table>
                            <p>
                                It also can also be used to allocate the content to the site. In this App`s case its get
                                the data from the backend using MongoDB and run a
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forEach</a> loop to display all the
                                blogs
                                line by line. This is enable us to display content that is not hard-coded, something
                                that
                                changing and does all this automatically. When you add or delete a blog, the APP will
                                send this information back
                                to the back-end database, make the changes and as soon as the page refresh, these
                                changes will be visible to you as
                                the loop re-run using the updated database. <br>
                                This was the first time I actually could truly engage with my own creation, which took
                                everything to a whole new
                                and very exiting level for me. Furthermore the the database is located on Amazon`s free
                                tier server in West-Virginia. Any changes you
                                make it actually will get sent there and back to you. Even now looking back to this
                                project, its nothing shy of amazing.

                                will be a solid base for this. I will need to do a bit on researh on the topic, but looking 
                                forward to start working towards it. Initally the communication only will be only available 
                                between my girlfriend and I, hence the name US. 
                                Once it will be completed I will share more information

                            <p>I absulutely loved the design. Its clean and fresh
                                and looks dynamic. I really thought by finishing the code following
                                the tutorial will pretty much wrap up this project, but I was wrong. Very wrong!

                            <p>As you can see on the site there are slides coming right to left for each
                                link you click on. These are sections, although it looks that they all different
                                components of the page but they are really not! <br> Just imagine a standard webpage as
                                a roll of paper. As you scroll down you go through different segments of the same paper.
                                Now imagine this roll to be cut up for a given dimensions(sections) and start piling up
                                these "card/sections" on top of each other. They all exist the same time, in front
                                of you but most of them gets hidden away by the first card. As the new section slides
                                in, the previous one stayes in the back. Each slides will have qualities such "hidden",
                                "back-section", "active" as and when required. <br> When I finished the initial project,
                                I realized there is an
                                issue while loading the page. The last slide that loads will be visible for a second and
                                kind of ruining the inital animation. Easy fix would be to add and empty black section
                                (no characthers pictures or
                                anything else) as the last card. When the 
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction" 
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOM</a> (document object model) gets loaded it
                                will be the last
                                card on top. Home section is "active" so will slide over it. Looks pretty neat.
                                The problem with this solution is that as the DOM grows bigger and starts running the
                                project NOT only locally, it will require more time for the DOM to load in, so the weird
                                trace of the second flashing up will come back. Even though we are quick, but to pile
                                the cards
                                on top of each other as fast that noone will be able to notice anything is more fast
                                than
                                we the speed possibly can do. Not to mention that these pack of cards getting bulkier!
                                <br>Okay the next
                                solution to the problem was to set all not needed sections to be hidden until the DOM
                                loaded.
                                That worked again for a while, but every now and then, it seems the issue came back with
                                a flash. The reason being is that the DOM loads first (line by line) and styling is
                                after. You
                                start putting the cards on top of each other, but you haven`t yet learnt the trick to
                                hide what you are doing. Its
                                becouse DOM is partially built by the time the CSS (which contians this trick) is
                                loaded.. I realised I
                                could do better.<br> Rather than leave a blank section as the last slide I should make
                                it
                                the first
                                and add it as "back-section" right away. Like this, when the HTML and right after the
                                CSS starts loading it will eliminate the issue. By the time it finishes the load the
                                whole
                                DOM (put the cards down) the back-section is already set (trick learnt) and the rest of
                                the page would not be
                                visible. Trickery! Altough it works this small/medium sized webpage, it wouldn`t be
                                recomended to use this
                                approach to anything significant. Either need to have the webpage component based
                                (React) or an
                                intersection observer needs to be set up. But I come back to this later on.

                            <h4>Jpeg vs. Webp</h4>
                            <p>Out of interest, I wanted to see how else I can make the page load faster. I have around
                                5-6 pictures added to the project. By checking out in the network tab in dev mode I saw
                                that each(Jpeg) takes
                                around 600-700ms to load. Webp images have around 15-30% less data than Jpeg as it
                                compresses more. But I also
                                read on Stackoverflow that they are harder to decode, so the gain is not as significant.
                                This answer was about 4 years ago,
                                so I wasn't sure if it still stands. I had to make my own testrun for it, just wanted to
                                know. <br> My original Jpegs weren`t
                                anything big to start with, but making them as a Webp the size got reduced even further.
                                I compared the page load time
                                using Jpeg vs Webp. What I found is that it means a small improvement in my case. I talk
                                around 0.0x seconds worth of
                                improvement. Although I didn't gain anything much, it's clear to see I would have more
                                and bigger
                                resolution (larger) images it would
                                make a difference. I just thought I share my findings after I invested in researching
                                and test the topic.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Component-tree / think before you do!</h4>
                            <p>
                                I mentioned above the DOM and how these "cards" get loaded on top of each other. Maybe
                                it looks like there are only 5-6
                                cards in this pack, but I have much more for show. This is why the problem started to
                                arise. Here is the component tree if you
                                would like to see. <a
                                    href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9iajqwwsgzomekd/comp-tree2.png?dl=0" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Component tree</a> You can see we have
                                well over 10 cards. Each of them gets sets to be "active" or "back-section"
                                or in some cases to be temporarily "hidden". It wouldn't be a problem at all if I leave
                                the project simple as it
                                started. But I didn't find it enough, I wanted it to have multiple layers to it. It
                                means you can click on the logo which is not
                                part of the navigation section but still brings up a section. Same with the
                                project-section, there are examples and even
                                inside the examples are more links to further slides. <br>Is this a problem? Not really,
                                but
                                what we need to understand is
                                that each click calls an event-listener. It means you click on something and will
                                execute a function. The navigation panel is
                                relatively straight forward. If someone clicks on a link on the navigation panel, set
                                the current card as a background section and
                                the new card as active. Simple and works as a wonder. Now imagine that you are not part
                                of this "chosen navigation panelgroup" or
                                you may just be part of one of the sections. Now the original functions wouldn't know
                                what should be the back-section
                                and which is the active. I need to further specify it. If this and this gets clicked do
                                this and that. But if you are
                                already there and something else gets clicked if this and that true/false do this or
                                that. What I`m trying to say with
                                all this salad? It means that I had to cover a whole list of scenarios to make this
                                happen. I have 5 navigation links
                                (the easy part), about 4 project examples with 4 more sections to link to them and
                                around 2-3 buttons to do similar
                                whichever part of the page. Now getting a bit more complicated you think? Yes and
                                no!<br>
                                Now imagine that each of your
                                clicks not just slides in a new section, but also highlights on the side section of the
                                page what the current content is. Wait
                                a minute! How about each click closes the theme-toggle section of the right of the page
                                when any of this gets clicked? Let's do
                                that as well, totally! How about making the web page more responsive, when it's on
                                mobile let the navigation side overflow the content, but
                                when it's around tablet size, let the navigation side push the content on the right, it
                                looks cool afterall! You know what I
                                want the page to be responsive to swipes! Yess!! We all want that! <br>And here we are
                                now a
                                whole lot of arrays of different
                                outcomes. We have if statements within if statements and functions in functions.
                                <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3yazozwp0g5o4/andras-example.png?dl=0"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is and example.</a>
                                Now we have to cover a lot. What shows on the navigation panel, what will happen on
                                small/medium/large screens,
                                what happens if the style toggle is already open, what happens when we swipe the
                                navigation panel to be open (all screen sizes),
                                but we close it with the button and swipe back.<br> What to learn from this? One thing
                                for
                                certain,
                                plan what you do! If I have had set up the page differently as I started with, knowing
                                that I want so much more from it,
                                I could have prepared it from the beginning. By no means I`m not happy with the result,
                                I am! It does look and feel nice
                                and all grounds are covered! But if I have know what I know now, I could streamline some
                                of the functions and make it more simple
                                to understand. It`s a learning curve and a valuable lesson for me. I want to return to
                                this project and rewrite the JS for it. I'm certain
                                I`ll be able to reduce the code by 30%. UPDATE: I done it and actually could reduce by more
                                than 40%. I go in to depth in this on the bottom of this page. 
                            </p>
                            <h4>Hammer.js (swipe) </h4>
                            <p style="padding-bottom:15px"> I used Hammer.js before in my Secrets project, so using it
                                this time
                                around was pretty much straight forward. The only issue I had is that although it worked
                                as it should on
                                desktop, but anytime I tried to use it responsively (mobile/tablet) it didn`t fire the
                                required functions.
                                Was a bit annoying to find the solution, but eventually I did. It was in the deeper
                                realm of codes, but seems
                                like I needed to overwrite something for it`s normal behaviour. I live the code here as
                                it was a bit tricky to find,
                                might offer a solution for someone who comes across similar issues.

                            <p>Welcome to the realm of Lazy-loading! If you are unfamiliar with the term: "Lazy-loading
                                is
                                the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects until they're
                                actually
                                needed to improve performance and save system resources." <br>Just imagine you scrolling
                                through
                                facebook/instagram, imagine that at the initial start of the app it would need to load
                                in all
                                the content for you. Would be quite a janke ride! Furthermore you might just open the
                                site for
                                a second or two, but it's taking over all of your bandwidth and loading all the content
                                even if
                                you won`t need them later on. <br>A solution exists! Many sites use an intersection
                                observer. It's
                                basically passing the message to the app what section of the site the user is currently
                                "consuming".
                                You can tell it "if the viewport is less than 500pixels away", start loading in the
                                images,
                                videos etc.
                                If you never reach that far on the site, it shall never load. A win-win-win
                                solution.<br>
                                The reason I
                                dive into this subject is because as I mentioned above I wanted to keep this project
                                light-weight as
                                possible. As soon as I embed a few YouTube videos, it went cra-cra in the network tab.

                                started to bombard the site with their scripts, figuring out what Ads to load and of
                                course load the
                                videos in. Remember, all sections are existing at the same time in this project. You
                                might not look
                                at the section where the video got embedded, but it will still load up. <br> I could use
                                an
                                intersection observer, but I didn't want to add an external library for this, especially
                                if my only
                                concern was the embedded videos. I went to find different solutions for this but I ended
                                up creating my
                                own one. Here is the work of others:

                            <p class="example-code">

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I liked the idea, but if you try it out, you can see that somehow is not really
                                elegant.
                                Many times the YouTube autoplay won't even work, so you basically need to click twice
                                for the video to start.
                                I also didn't like that a custom icon has to be used on top of the pictures.. Anyhow,
                                here is my take on the subject:<br>
                                Before I dive into this, we need to know what is
                                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Iframe</a>.
                                Iframe is (it is in its name) a frame which lets you embed another HTML page into the
                                current one. It has its own
                                properties like style, history and document. It`s not interact with the parent HTML. So
                                what the guys were doing
                                on that two example is that they put a image into the iframe with some icon on top as a
                                play button using srcdoc property.<br>
                                This lets you pretty much put the whole page as an inline element within the iframe.
                                Anyways, let's not go too deep.
                                There is a picture once it gets clicked will start to play the YouTube video as long
                                autoplay works..<br> As I mentioned,
                                I didn't like that it looks different and you need to double click a lot of times, but
                                my main concern was that I
                                would have to put a lot of lengthy inner styling in my HTML and I really like the clean
                                look of the code as it was.
                                I started to develop an idea to move everything to the JS to later be injected into the
                                iframe when needed. But I
                                still didn't like that there is a lot of HTML and CSS in my JS. And playing around hit
                                me the simplest idea.
                                <br>There is something called <a
                                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">innerHTML</a>.
                                This can be set. I've done it before! What I did is that I prepped an empty div which
                                will be injected using this innerHTML.
                                What happens when the page loads, we have empty divs(containers if you like). But when
                                you click on the whatever project
                                it will call a function which will set the innerHTML to the iframe we need. It works as
                                magic, but as YouTube is not
                                messing around and right away starts to bombard you with the video and Ads so on, messed
                                up my animation. What I
                                did was I wrote another function with a loading gif image. When you click on the
                                project, it's setting that image,
                                but after 0.5s it's resetting the iframe again, now to the actual video. No double click
                                or wierd icons and my code
                                remained clean! <br>One thing to know that after you click away I also had to write a
                                function as you may not on that
                                section now, but youtube would just continue playing in the backgroubd and steal your
                                bandwidth. So when
                                you click away, the iframe
                                will be set back to the gif I just mentioned. Pretty nice solution, I`m proud of it,
                                it's my child!

                            <h4>Bits and bobs'</h4>
                            <p>I covered most of the real challenges above, but there were quite a few minor-ish things
                                I wanted to sort out. I needed to set what happens when the form on the contact section
                                gets sent off. As this project doesn't have a backend and neither i wanted to have one I
                                found
                                few free services that can be used. I ended up using
                                <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">formsubmit.co</a>. Easy peasy! <br>I also wanted
                                to make the styling more appealing. For example if you are in tablet/mobile you cant
                                open the
                                navigation section and the theme toggler together and even if one of them is open, if
                                you click
                                away to do something else it will be closing them. Originally it would have remaining on
                                the
                                screen regardless what section you are heading, blocking the content. I done this to
                                work by
                                both clicks and swipes among other things. <br>I also wanted the page to be more
                                responsive.
                                Originally it was sort of responsive, but a lot of times the content got squeezed in too
                                much,
                                or just the space wasn`t enough to fit all in. On portrait mode was straight forward as
                                the
                                project had a good base, but i also needed to among a few things which later i carried
                                over
                                to landscape mode as well. For example open the website on mobile, open the navigation
                                menu
                                and now tilt your phone into landscape mode. You will be able to see what I'm talking
                                about.
                                <br>I also added an About me section, by using the logo which also animates on click and
                                when
                                the section is active. I think it looks pretty nice. Changed the style-toggler.
                                Previously
                                wasn`t obvious right away when you click the colours that it actually is selected.
                                So I went the extra mile to fix this and make it look better. The colours are kind of
                                see
                                trough, but when it gets clicked its become solid colour with a border. Oh yes, one
                                more
                                thing, double tap changes the dark theme to light and back.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Takeaway</h4>
                            <p>
                                I`ve learnt a lot during these past few weeks. The project-tutorial was amazing, it
                                taught me
                                a lot about how to structure a website properly. I already used most of the technique he
                                used,
                                but definitely helped me to reassure the proper use of
                                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">css-selectors</a>. Furthermorepreviously I mostly used
                                grids or
                                flexboxes to design and this is the first time using
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">flex</a>
                                property. It alway was the first time that I used
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">before/after</a>
                                pseudo elements as part of the design. <br>
                                I had a lot of practice creating custom functions and adding event
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event-listeners</a>.
                                It was really valuable and helped me to work out the logic time and time again. This
                                also taught me where I did go wrong with the project.
                                I should have thought about what I really want from this prior. It would have made my
                                work so much easier. Don`t get me wrong,
                                I`m not disappointed by this. I just had ideas on the way I started to execute them bit
                                by bit. <br>
                                For now I say goodbye to this lovely project. We had some good times together! I plan to
                                return and
                                sort out the JS a bit at some point. I shall see you again soon friend! bye
