                                    <p>ReactJS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library. It's a declarative
                                        language that helps to build complex and interactive UIs whilst carrying the
                                        potential for each component to be reusable.

                                    <p>Git tracks and records changes to the code. I started with Git Cli using it in a

                                  I decided to create my own project. Its using a combination of React useStates and Redux-Rtk for statemanagment. To spice things up I tried to recreate the windows calculators logic including having access to calculation history. I also added theme & sound settings and able to dispatch simple api calls to this projects hero, Chuck Norris.

                                I was searching for different animated web-designs that offer me valuable assets and
                                functionalities to learn from. I found a very fascinating tutorial on YouTube that
                                sparked my interest and that I considered a good fit for my goal in creating a
                                functional, smooth but also elegant webpage
                                (<a href=https://youtu.be/zJE-ze4TfXc target="_blank"

                                I wanted to learn more in-depth on how to use divs and classes more efficiently. By
                                writing the code parallel I understood the structural and design aspects of the site,
                                which I was so keen to learn. Once I finished, I started tailoring the site more to my
                                needs and own ideas and added some extra features to it. This also makes one of the
                                highest share in time I spent on a project. Although the site overall doesn't look very
                                different to the original one, there are a lot more elements and features I brought to

                                registered users can interact with the database. For this I used firabse authentication
                                and also a context-provider & protected routes. When visitor arrives on the landing-site
                                an object gets created and unless the authentication has taken place it won't let user
                                go any further and gets redirected to login/register. In Firebase itself, I built the
                                set up in a way that only registered users can manipulate the database. You can read
                                about this project a lot more in details by going to the actual webAPP and click on the
                                logo and read more. I wanted to keep this project as simple as possible. As an
                                additional nuance, I am planning to add sessions (cookies) to the app and limiting
                                content manipulation only to the user for their own content only. Please click the

                            <p>It was a barebone project using MongoDB in the back-end with simple crud operations and
                                EJS. I added an authentication feature and session cookies to the project (<a
                                    href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Express</a>).
                                Users only can interact with their own content (secrets) but are able to read other
                                user's posts. Once a user has run through this authentication process, he/she will
                                remain logged in unless the cookie is expired, or the users exits the browser. You can
                                aslo read more in details at the about/read more section of the page. Overall, I am very
                                proud of the project outcome, in regard to how I successfully experimented with features
                                but also in regards to user engagement, seeing that quite a good number of “secrets”
                                have been shared after I posted the project link in a study group to share my
                                experience. You can find a very detailed report of the Secrets-Project in the read

                            <h3>A challenge with React</h3>
                            <p id="phide" class="opacity100">This started off as a coding-challenge during my studies.
                                It was about creating a simple react-app where we practiced the correct use of <a
                                    href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">props</a> and the <a
                                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_es6_spread.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">spread operator</a>.
                                I love using React, finally I have something that is instant and doesn't require refresh
                                or redirect. That is the reason why, after completing the challenge, I wanted to take
                                this further and have a back-end for it. The idea of CRUD started to appear to me and
                                eventually this project was the base for it. This app has never been deployed, but with
                                the help of embedding I'm still able to share it with you. Please click the button to

                            <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">This App was a coding-challenge and part of my studies on
                                Udemy. After finishing it, it also served as a base to the Secrets App above. It uses
                                <a href="https://ejs.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EJS</a> (Embedded
                                JavaScript Templating).
                                EJS let us embed JavaScript code into HTML. It can come very handy in many different
                                ways: Firstly, it can reduce the repetition of the code. For example you have a website
                                with 2-3 redirects to different sections of the page. You can simply write the
                                header/footer or any other parts of the webpage only once and inject it to your HTML
                                code like follows:
                            </p>
                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px; text-align: center;" class="example-code">
                                            &lt%=header=%&gt<br>
                                            content <br>
                                            &lt%=footer=%&gt
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                    <td>
                                        <p style="padding-bottom: 15px;" class="example-code">
                                            &lt== &nbsp unchanged <br>
                                            &lt== &nbsp changing <br>
                                            &lt== &nbsp unchanged
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                            </table>
                            <p>
                                Secondly, it can be used to allocate the content to the site. In this App's case it
                                receives the data from the backend using MongoDB and runs a
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forEach</a>
                                loop to display all the blogs line by line. This enables us to display content that is
                                not hard-coded in the html. When the backend database gets updated the changes get
                                displayed automatically. When you add or delete a blog, the APP will send this
                                information back to the back-end database, make the changes and as soon as the page
                                refreshes, these changes will be visible to you as the loop re-run using the updated
                                database.
                                <br>
                                This was the first time I actually could truly engage with my own creation, which took
                                everything to a whole new and very exciting level for me. Furthermore, the database is
                                located on Amazon's free tier server in West-Virginia. Any changes you make will
                                actually be sent there and back to you. Even now looking back to this project, it is
                                fairly amazing.

                                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a>. We were studying <a
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">RESTful Api</a> creating api-calls with the use of
                                body-parser and get the information
                                back from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Openweathermap.org</a>.
                                I liked the idea, so I added a styling with Bootstrap 5. As I wanted to cover more
                                possible outcomes (typo etc.) I added Ejs to it.
                                With a pretty background and some transparencies set it was ready to be deployed as a
                                tiny stand alone project. I think it looks great!<br>
                                In the future I'm planning to repeat this project with React and React-native with 5
                                days forecast. I think it would be very handy to have all these information available
                             on a click of a button.

                            <p>My plan is to create a chat-app that can be installed on android devices. This will be
                                the first time for me using React Native, but I have gained a sufficient knowledge base
                                during the built of CRUD that will help me here. I will need to do a bit of research on
                                the topic, but I am looking forward to starting to work with it. As a kick off, the
                                communication will only be available between my girlfriend and me, hence the name US.
                                Once it will be completed I will share more information about it. You can follow my progress <a href="https://github.com/AndrasE/usapp"

                            <p>Thank you for checking out my webpage! I thought I would share some information about my
                                coding-journey and about me
                                as a person.
                                <br> I've always been interested in IT and Electronics in general, but I started to
                                develop keen interest in coding
                                about two years ago and started committing myself to study it daily. It came with
                                sacrifices (gave up gaming, and some of my
                                gym classes) as I have a full-time job and limited amount of free time to spare, but I
                                haven't regretted it once.
                                Something about researching a topic and finding solutions give me such a boost to my
                                studies that I just haven't
                                stopped since I started. The creation itself and coming up with answers for challenges
                                are very satisfying.
                                <br>In my personal life I like to be active. I do thai-boxing, longboarding and
                                photography every now and then. In
                                my remaining time I follow the IT/Hardware news. It's amazing how far the word has come
                                since commodore 64! I also like
                                following topics in astronomy (really excited about the James Webb telescope), physics,
                                psychology related to
                                deviant behaviours and occasionally chemistry. I have been an avid music collector since
                                I was child, and also learned to play the drums when I was a teenager. At some point I
                                really
                                believed I'll be a professional drummer. I'm passionate about music and new releases and
                                join concerts whenever I can. As you can see I have broad interests,
                                probably it might be related to being an INFJ personality type.
                                <br>Thank you for reading, I wish you all the best for now! ❤

                            <p>I absolutely loved the design as it is clean, fresh and looks dynamic. I really thought
                                by finishing the code following the tutorial will pretty much wrap up this project, but
                                I was wrong. Very wrong!
                            </p>
                            <h4>Sections</h4>
                            <p>As you can see on the site there are slides coming right to left for each link you click
                                on. These are sections, although it looks that they are all different components of the
                                page, but they are really not!
                                <br>
                                Just imagine a standard webpage as a roll of paper. As you scroll down you go through
                                different segments of the same paper. Now imagine this roll to be cut up into a certain
                                number of dimensions (sections) and start piling up these "card/sections" on top of each
                                other. They all exist the same time, in front of each other, but most of them get hidden
                                away by the first card. As the new section slides in, the previous one stays in the
                                back. Each slide will have classes such as "hidden", "back-section" or "active" when
                                required.
                                <br>
                                When I finished the initial project, I realized there is an issue while loading the
                                page. The last slide that loads will be visible for a second and kind of ruining the
                                initial animation. An easy fix would be to add an empty black section (without any
                                characters, pictures or other elements) as the last card. When the
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOM</a>
                                (document object model) gets loaded it will be the last card on top. The Home section is
                                "active" so will slide over it - that makes it look pretty neat. The problem with this
                                solution is that as the DOM (Document Object Model) grows bigger and starts running the
                                project not only locally, it will require more time for the DOM to load in, so for the
                                trace of the second flashing-up some of the sections will come back. By the time we load
                                the last sections, which is now set as a blank section won't load fast enough for us
                                anymore. We pack the sections on top of each other, but by the time we reach the last
                                section some of the other cards will get displayed again as we have more content to
                                display and each section will get much bulkier and requires more time to load in.
                                <br>
                                Only the next solution to the problem was to set all not needed sections to be hidden
                                until the DOM loaded. That worked again for a while, but every now and then it seemed
                                the issue came back with a flash. The reason being is that the DOM loads first (line by
                                line) and styling is after. You start putting the cards on top of each other, but you
                                haven't yet learnt the trick to hide what you are doing. Its because DOM is partially
                                built by the time the CSS (which contains this trick) is loaded. I realised I need to
                                find a more feasible solution.
                                <br>
                                Rather than leave a blank section as the last slide, I should make it the first and add
                                it as "back-section" right away. Like this, when the HTML starts loading followed by the
                                CSS it will eliminate the issue. By the time it finishes the load the whole DOM (put the
                                cards down) the back-section is already set (lesson learnt) and the rest of the page
                                would not be visible. Trickery! Although it works for this small/medium sized webpage,
                                it would not be recommended to use this approach to larger sized webpages. It would need
                                to be either set up component-based (React) or there needs to be an
                                intersection-observer set up. But I will come back to this later on.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Jpeg vs. Webp</h4>
                            <p>Out of interest, I wanted to see how else I can make the page load faster. I have around
                                5-6 pictures added to the project. By checking out in the network tab in dev mode I saw
                                that each picture (Jpeg) takes around 600-700ms to load. Webp images have around 15-30%
                                less data than Jpeg as it compresses more. But I also read on Stackoverflow that they
                                are harder to decode, so the gain is not as significant. This answer was posted on the
                                blog about four years ago, so I was not sure about its validity today. So in the end I
                                had to make my own testrun for it as I really wanted to overcome this problem.
                                <br>
                                My original Jpegs were not that heavy, but in turning them into a Webp the size got
                                reduced even further. I compared the page load time using Jpeg vs Webp. The result was a
                                small reduction in loading time of around 0.0x seconds, however an improvement. Although
                                the improvement is small, it would make a significant difference when using much larger
                                and therefore heavier images. So it is still worth sharing my findings after I invested
                                in researching and testing the topic.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I mentioned above the DOM and how these "cards" get loaded on top of each other. Maybe
                                it looks like there are only 5-6 cards in this pack, but I have much more to show. This
                                is why the problem started to evolve. Here is the component tree if you would like to

                                You can see we have over 10 cards. Each of them gets classified in "active" or
                                "back-section" or in some cases to be temporarily "hidden". It wouldn't be a problem at
                                all if I leave the project simple as it started. But I didn't find it sufficient as I
                                wanted it to have multiple layers to it. It means you can click on the logo which is not
                                part of the navigation section but still brings up a section. Same with the
                                project-section, there are examples and even inside the examples are more links to
                                further slides.
                                <br>
                                Is this a problem? Not really, but what we need to understand is that each click calls
                                an event-listener. It means you click on something and will execute a function. The
                                navigation panel is relatively straight forward: If someone clicks on a link on the
                                navigation panel, it sets the current card as a background section and the new card as
                                active. Simple and works smoothly. Now imagine that you are not part of this "chosen
                                navigation panel-group" or you may just be part of one of the sections. The original
                                functions wouldn't know what should be the back-section and which is the active. I need
                                to further specify it. If this and this gets clicked, do this and that. But if you are
                                already there and something else gets clicked if this and that is true/false then do
                                this or that. What I'm trying to say with all this salad? It means that I had to cover a
                                whole list of scenarios to make this happen. I have five navigation links (the easy
                                part), about four project examples with four more sections to link to them and around
                                two to three buttons to do similar actions on the page. Now getting a bit more
                                complicated you think? Yes and no!
                                <br>
                                Now imagine that each of your clicks not just slides in a new section, but also
                                highlights on the side section of the page what the current content is. Wait a minute!
                                How about each click closes the theme-toggle section on the right of the page when any
                                of this gets clicked? Let's do that as well, totally! How about making the web page more
                                responsive, when it's on mobile let the navigation side overflow the content, but when
                                it's around tablet size, let the navigation side push the content on the right, it looks
                                cool after all! You know that I want the page to be responsive to swipes - we all want
                                that! <br>And here we are now with a whole lot of arrays of different outcomes. We have
                                if-statements within if-statements and functions in functions.
                                <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4p3yazozwp0g5o4/andras-example.png?dl=0"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is an example.</a>
                                Now we have to cover a lot. What shows on the navigation panel, what will happen on
                                small/medium/large screens, what happens if the style toggle is already open, what
                                happens when we swipe the navigation panel to be open (all screen sizes) but we close it
                                with the button and swipe back.
                                <br>
                                What to learn from this? One thing for certain, plan what you do! If I have had set up
                                the page differently from the start, knowing that I want so much more from it, I could
                                have prepared it from the beginning. That doesn't mean I am not happy with the outcome
                                of the page, in fact I am very happy - it does look and feel nice and all grounds are
                                covered! But if I had all these learnings and this fantastic knowledge beforehand, I
                                would have been able streamline some of the functions and make it more simple to
                                understand. It's a great learning curve and a valuable lesson for me. I want to return
                                to this project and rewrite the JS for it. I'm certain I'll be able to reduce the code
                                by 30%.

                                <br>
                                UPDATE: I have realized this objective and was able to actually reduce the script by
                                more than 40%. Let me go into depth on this at the bottom of this page.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Hammer.js (swipe) </h4>
                            <p style="padding-bottom:15px"> I used Hammer.js before in my Secrets project, so using it
                                this time around was pretty much straight forward. The only issue I had is that although
                                it worked well desktop, anytime I tried to use it responsively (mobile/tablet) it didn't
                                fire the required functions. I needed to find the solution to overwrite the
                                touch-input/mouse-input's initial behaviour. I leave the code here as it was a bit
                                tricky to find, might offer a solution for someone who comes across similar issues.
                            </p>
                            <p class="example-code">
                                const hammer = new Hammer(document.getElementById('gesture-element'), {inputClass:
                                Hammer.TouchMouseInput});
                            </p>
                            <h4>Lazy-loading</h4>
                            <p>Welcome to the realm of Lazy-loading! If you are unfamiliar with the term: "Lazy-loading
                                is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects until they're
                                actually needed to improve performance and save system resources."
                                <br>
                                Just imagine you are scrolling through Facebook/Instagram and that at the initial start
                                of the app it would need to load in all the content for you. Would be quite a long ride!
                                Furthermore you might just open the site for a second or two, but it's taking over all
                                of your bandwidth and loading all the content even if you won't need them later on.
                                <br>
                                A solution exists! Many sites use an intersection observer. It's basically passing the
                                message to the app what section of the site the user is currently "consuming". You can
                                tell it "if the viewport is less than 500pixels away", start loading in the images,
                                videos etc. If you never reach that far on the site, it shall never load. A win-win-win
                                solution.
                                <br>
                                The reason I dive into this subject is because as I mentioned above I wanted to keep
                                this project as light-weight as possible. As soon as I embedded a few YouTube videos, it
                                went all over the place in the network tab. YouTube/Google started to bombard the site
                                with their scripts, figuring out which ads to load plus loading all the videos in.
                                Remember, all sections are existing at the same time in this project. You might not look
                                at the section where the video got embedded, but it will still load up.
                                <br>
                                I could use an intersection observer, but I didn't want to add an external library for
                                this, especially if my only concern was the embedded videos. I went to find different
                                solutions for this but I ended up creating my own one. Here is the work of others:
                            </p>
                            <p class="example-code">
                                Solutions: &nbsp;
                                <a href="https://youtu.be/khdT1e7jEIE" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Example-1</a> &nbsp;
                                <a href="https://css-tricks.com/lazy-load-embedded-youtube-videos/" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Example-2</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I liked the idea, but if you try it out, you can see that somehow it is not really
                                elegant. Many times the YouTube autoplay won't even work, so you basically need to click
                                twice for the video to start. I also didn't like that a custom icon has to be used on
                                top of the pictures. So here is my take on this subject:
                                <br>
                                Before I dive into this, we need to know what is
                                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Iframe</a>.
                                Iframe is (it is in its name) a frame which lets you embed another HTML page into the
                                current one. It has its own properties like style, history and document. It does not
                                interact with the parent HTML. So what the guys were doing on these two examples is
                                putting an image into the iframe with some icon on top which serves as a play button
                                using srcdoc property.
                                <br>
                                This lets you pretty much put the whole page as an inline element within the iframe.
                                Anyways, let's not go too deep. There is a picture once it gets clicked will start to
                                play the YouTube video as long autoplay works..
                                <br>
                                As I mentioned, I didn't like that it looks different and you need to double click a lot
                                of times, but my main concern was that I would have to put a lot of lengthy inner
                                styling in my HTML and I really like the clean look of the code as it was. I started to
                                develop an idea to move everything to the JS to later being injected into the iframe
                                when needed. But I still didn't like that there is a lot of HTML and CSS in my JS. And
                                playing around hit me with the simplest idea.
                                <br>
                                There is something called
                                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">innerHTML</a>.
                                This can be set. I've done it before! What I did is that I prepped an empty div which
                                will be injected using this innerHTML. What happens when the page loads, we have empty
                                divs (containers if you like). But when you click on a certain project it will call a
                                function which will set the innerHTML to the iframe we need. It works perfectly, but as
                                YouTube is not messing around and right away starts to bombard you with the video and
                                ads, it messed up my animation. What I did was writing another function with a loading
                                gif image. When you click on the project, it's setting that image, but after 0.5s it's
                                resetting the iframe again, now to the actual video. No double click or misleading
                                icons, and furthermore my code remained clean!
                                <br>
                                I also had to write a function to stop Youtube continue playing in the background a when
                                you click away from the section that embeds the video. In this case the iframe will be
                                set back to the gif I just mentioned. Pretty nice solution, I'm proud of it, it's my
                                child!
                            </p>
                            <h4>Bits and bobs'</h4>
                            <p>I covered most of the real challenges above, but there were quite a few minor-ish things
                                I wanted to sort out. I needed to set what happens when the form on the contact section
                                gets sent off. As this project doesn't have a backend and neither I wanted to have one I
                                found few free services that can be used. I ended up using
                                <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">formsubmit.co</a>. Easy peasy!
                                <br>
                                I also wanted to make the styling more appealing. For example if you are in
                                tablet/mobile you cant open the navigation section and the theme toggler together and
                                even if one of them is open, if you click away to do something else it will close them.
                                Originally it would have remained on the screen regardless what section you are heading
                                to, blocking the content. I have done this to work by both clicks and swipes among other
                                things.
                                <br>
                                I also wanted the page to be more responsive. Originally it was sort of responsive, but
                                a lot of times the content got squeezed in too much, or just the space wasn't enough to
                                fit all in. On portrait mode it was straight forward as the project had a good base, but
                                I also needed to convert it into landscape mode as well. For example open the website on
                                mobile, open the navigation menu and now tilt your phone into landscape mode. You will
                                be able to see what I'm talking about.
                                <br>
                                I also added an About me section, using the logo which also animates on click and when
                                the section is active, and I changed the style-toggler here. I think it looks pretty
                                nice. Previously it wasn't obvious right away which particular colour you had selected.
                                So I went the extra mile to fix this and make it look better. The colours are kind of
                                see-trough, but when you click on it turns into solid colour with a border. Oh yes, one
                                more thing, double tap changes the dark theme to light and back.

                            <h4>Takeaway</h4>
                            <p>I've learnt a lot during these past few weeks. The project-tutorial was amazing, it
                                taught me a lot about how to structure a website properly. I already used most of the
                                technique he used, but definitely it helped me to reassure the proper use of
                                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">css-selectors</a>.
                                Furthermorepreviously I mostly used grids or flexboxes to design and this is the first
                                time using
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">flex</a>
                                property. It was also the first time that I used
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">before/after</a>
                                pseudo elements as part of the design.
                                <br>
                                I had a lot of practice creating custom functions and adding
                                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event-listeners</a>.
                                It was really valuable and helped me to work out the logic time and time again. This
                                also taught me where I did go wrong with the project. I should have thought about what I
                                really want from this prior to the work I invested. It would have made my work so much
                                easier. Don't get me wrong, I'm not disappointed by this. I just had ideas on the way
                                started to execute them bit by bit.
                                <br>
                                For now I say goodbye to this lovely project. We had some good times together! I plan to
                                return and sort out the JS a bit at some point. I shall see you again soon friend! bye
                            </p>

                            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">UPDATE</h4>
                            <p>Since I wrote What's about, I made a number of changes to the page. And I was right, I
                                could significantly reduce the amount of lines I coded, but most importantly I made it
                                far easier to understand. I made everything as nice and tidy as I could. What I wrote in
                                the Takeaway section is completely right. I wanted to make It happen so badly that I
                                didn't stop and think about it. Instead of writing several for each loop and separate
                                functions and trying to counter the unwanted side effects each of their own, I simply
                                linked section-links to the corresponding section regardless if it is a navigation
                                element or button or even an image. TThis way all works within one foreach loop and
                                hardly any unwanted animation mishaps I needed to counter.

                                <br>But apart from this very valuable lesson, I made several other changes as well. I
                                rewrote my lazy-load function, it both starts and stops the videos if needed,
                                furthermore I made a codesandbox embed as well with it. I wrote some animation to make
                                it more sleek. I'm happy with the outcome. I also embedded a tiny beginner project I
                                had, which I also rewrote so it fits the iframe correctly using @media queries.
                                <br>
                                Now I consider this project to be done! It was a pleasure!
